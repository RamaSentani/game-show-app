# Wheel of Success
## browser version of “Wheel of Success”
A word guessing game where players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase.

Using JavaScript, to create an array of phrases and write functions to choose a random phrase from that array, split the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the game board.

Each time the player guesses a letter, it compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the game board updates with the chosen letters.

A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. If the letter they chose isn’t in the phrase, the player loses one health.

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen will display. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen will display.

A player can guess a letter only once. After they’ve guessed a letter, that letter is disabled.
